## The Tax Reform India 1% Theory Data Prediction Analysis


## Purpose

An average income taxpayer pays nearly 50% of their income in taxes, yet they have to live in substandard facilities, face constant inflation, and sadly receive no support from the local government.

Local governments receive no funds from the central government due to a lack of resources. As a result, nearly 600 million people, including 22 million income taxpayers, are affected.

We aim to solve this critical problem of poor tax collections, a narrow tax base, and multiple taxation with our 1% Tax Proposal. 

This project is made so we can all make an prediction of the impact that will have if we implemented the 1% tax system.

On the prediction analysis we can see the results and can also improve the 1% theory.

This helps in running a simulation without actually affecting the real world.
